I don't really know yet :)

This is just a short post so there's not just a big, blank screen when you first
visit.

But while I'm here -- I built something pretty cool!

Give it a try, especially if you're confused about pointers in C -- it might
help!
It's definitely a toy/prototype at this stage -- but I'm planning to keep
hacking on it, it was a fun project to put together over a couple of days.
