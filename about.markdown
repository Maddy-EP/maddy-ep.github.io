Hi! I'm Maddy :)

I'm just an autistic trans almost-30-year-old that really likes computers,
media, and having loud opinions.

Contrary to what buffoons like RFK Jr. would have you believe: I pay taxes, I
use the restroom unassisted, I have a full-time job, and there is a _massive_
amount of love in my life, despite the ceaseless horrors.

More seriously: I grew up in the Midwest, got my BS/MS in computer science on
the East coast, and now live and work on the West coast.
I work in a variety of areas (cryptography, systems, formal
methods/verification, UI/UX), but have mostly been interested in what it means
to do 'good' / 'principled' software engineering lately.

Outside of my special interest, I spend copious amounts of my free time watching
TV/movies and playing video games -- activities I simply didn't have time for
while growing up (had to be Succeeding at all times, or else!)

I haven't fully decided what I'm going to use this site for -- I stopped being
reliable enough to maintain a blog years ago, but the appeal has never fully
gone away.
I also have longer-term and more permanent forms of writing I would like to do,
especially as far as educational computer science/mathematics materials are
concerned.
It will also certainly be the home of any personal projects / writing I do over
the course of those -- even though I've _rarely_ had any ongoing personal
projects.

Thanks for being here on my little corner of the Internet!
I post on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/maddyep.com) (mostly gushy trans
lesbian things), and I'd like to start streaming regularly on
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/AnotherTransMaddy) again at some point in the near
future.

Thanks for reading this!
You rule for that.
