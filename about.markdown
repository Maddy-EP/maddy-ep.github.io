Hi! I'm Maddy :)

I'm an autistic and trans almost-30-year-old that really likes
computers, media, and having loud opinions.
Contrary to what buffoons like RFK Jr. would have you believe: I pay
taxes, I use the restroom unassisted, I have a full-time job, and
there is a _massive_ amount of love in my life, despite the ceaseless
horrors.

More seriously: I grew up in the Midwest, got my BS/MS in computer
science on the East coast, and now live and work on the West coast.
I work in a variety of areas (cryptography, systems, formal
methods/verification, UI/UX), but these days I'm mostly interested in
figuring out what it means to do 'good' and 'principled' software
engineering.

Outside of my special interest, I spend copious amounts of my free
time watching TV/movies and playing video games -- activities I simply
didn't have time for while growing up.

I haven't fully decided what I'm going to use this site for -- I
stopped being reliable enough to maintain a truly regular blog years
ago, but the appeal of doing that has never really gone away.
I also have longer-term and more permanent forms of writing I would
like to do, especially as far as educational computer
science/mathematics materials are concerned.

Who knows -- I may also write about personal projects, since I'm
starting to get into the habit of working on those again.

Thanks for being here on my little corner of the Internet!
I post on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/maddyep.com) (mostly
gushy trans lesbian things), and I'd like to start streaming regularly
on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/AnotherTransMaddy) again at some point
in the near future, if you want to follow me there.
